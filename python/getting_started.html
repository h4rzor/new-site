<body style="background-color:lightslategray;">
    <h1 align="center">Getting started</h1>
    <br>
    <div align="center">
        <p>I'm going to begin with the go-to command that everyone is doing when
            they start with programming, that is "Hello world"
        </p>
        <p>HINT: To execute or run the following cell, you need to press Shift+Enter</p>
        <div align="left">
            <py-repl output-mode="replace">print("Hello world")</py-repl>
        </div>
        <p>And just like that, you've run your first python program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let's kick it up a notch and introduce variables. variables
            store information that is used later. It could be whole numbers,
            words(or strings), objects and so on.
        </p>
        <div align="left">
            <py-repl>
                a = 5
                print(a)
            </py-repl>
        </div>
        <p>This is almost self explanatory. We have the name of the variable on the left
            and we have the variable's value on the right. Now, the 'a' variable is holding
            the value 5, if you run the cell, you will see that 'a' will be equal to 5.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>I'm going to introduce the string. It's widely used to store some form
            of text data.
        </p>
        <div align="left">
            <py-repl>
                x = "hey there"
                print(x)
            </py-repl>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>Next, I'm going to introduce the Equal, Greater or Less than symbols.</p>
        <div align="left">
            <py-repl>a = 5
                b = 10
                if a < b: print("b is larger") </py-repl>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>You could probably tell what's going on here. If 'a' is less than 'b'
                        then print something to the screen. In this case, 'a' is less than 'b'
                        so, it's printing.
                    </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I'm going to continue with the importat things for AI, numbers. Numbers could be
            int(whole), float(fractions), complex.
        </p>
        <div align="left">
            <py-repl>
                x = 1 # int
                y = 2.8 # float
                z = 1j # complex

                print(type(x))
                print(type(y))
                print(type(z))
            </py-repl>
            <br>
            <p>You could see that you can get the type of the variable by simply
                printing it to the page. This is very useful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The next big thing is called casting. Whenever you feel appropriate
                to turn one variables' type into another, you could use casting.
                In the cell below I'm using it to turn the float variable 'a' to
                integer(whole number) and the integer variable 'b' to float number.
            </p>
            <div align="left">
                <py-repl>
                    a = 5.8
                    b = 5
                    print(int(a))
                    print(type(float(b)))
                </py-repl>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I'm going to skip ahead to some of the most useful stuff from now on.
                They are called lists and they contain information, just like the other
                types I've shown. The difference is that they could contain multiple variables
                in them. So, whenever they are printed or called, they usually contain more
                than one variable or value. Of course, they could hold nothing.
            </p>
            <div align="left">
                <py-repl>
                    a = [1,2,3]
                    print(a)
                </py-repl>
                <p>But what happens when you decide to get only one of the values
                    inside the list? We have this thing called indexing and slicing.
                    Whenever you want to access a value in the list, you tell Python
                    at what index you want the value, and Python will get it for you
                    if this index exists.
                    <br>
                    REMEMBER: indexing starts at zero, so, the first element of the list
                    is at index 0.
                </p>
                <div align="left">
                    <py-repl>
                        a = [65,32,98]
                        b = a[0]
                        print(b)
                    </py-repl>
                    <p>As you can see, I got the first element by indexing.But what about
                        the other elements. For example the last element. It's not really convenient
                        to count all the variables until the last one, so Python made it really
                        handy to use [-1].
                    </p>
                    <div align="left">
                        <py-repl>
                            a = [65,32,98]
                            b = a[-1]
                            print(b)
                        </py-repl>
                    </div>
                    <p>I'm going to continue with the other very useful thing about Pythons' lists
                        and that is slicing. What if you want to take the values from the first index
                        until the third index. How are you going to get it. Python again made it very simple.
                    </p>
                    <div align="left">
                        <py-repl>
                            a = [65,32,92,33,712,10]
                            b = [1:3]
                        </py-repl>
