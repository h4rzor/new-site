    <h1 align="center">Getting started with some maths</h1>
    <h3 align="center">There are a considerable amount of topics of Machine Learning, especially on maths.
        I'm going to try to narrow it down to topics that are useful in Machine Learning in general, not 
        useful in math as a whole.
    </h3>
    <p>1. Linear Algebra</p>
    <p>Linear algebra is a  mathematical discipline that deals with vectors and matrices and, more
        generally, with vector spaces and linear transformations. Unlike other parts of mathematics 
        that are frequently invigorated by new ideas and unsolved problems, linear algebra is
        very well understood. Its value lies in its many applications, from mathematical physics 
        to modern algebra and coding theory.
    </p>
    <p>This sound great! In ML there are major uses for linear algebra, you will be working with vectors matrices 
        and linear transformations. These are the things that are in the basis of the AI revolution.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1.1 Scalar
        </li>
        <p>What is a scalar?</p>
        <p>A physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude. Examples of scalars are 
            volume, density, speed, energy, mass, and time.
        </p>
        <p>Example of a scalar is the volume of a thing. V = 4.23m^3.</p>
        <p>Every time we initiate a variable like this, it's a scalar.</p>
        <py-repl>
            a = 5.234
            a
        </py-repl>
        <p>Different operations that you could do with scalars include: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
            Division, Exponentiation, Floor Division, Modulus, every comparison operator and increment and decrement.
            Pretty much the whole suite of things.
        </p>
        <p>Let's see some of them.</p>
        <py-repl>
            a = 5.643
            b = a + 2
            c = a - 5
            d = a * 10
            e = a / 2
            f = a ** 2
            g = a // 
            h = a % 2
            b, c, d, e, f, g, h
        </py-repl>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            1.2 Vectors
        </li>
        <p>Vectors are simply more than one scalars in a single data structures. For the purpose of 
            Machine Learnign at least. In maths terms: a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: magnitude and direction.
        </p>
        <p>You can do plenty of things with vectors.</p>
        <p>Arithmetic operations:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])
            vector_b = np.array([4,5,6])
            
            #Addition
            addition = vector_a + vector_b

            #Subtraction
            subtraction = vector_b - vector_a

            #Multiplication
            multiplication = vector_a * vector_b

            #Division 
            division = vector_b / vector_a


            addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
        </py-repl>
        <p>This looks similar to the previous operations with the scalars.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Dot product:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np
            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])
            vector_b = np.array([4,5,6])

            dot_prod = np.dot(vector_a, vector_b)

            dot_prod
        </py-repl>
        <p>You take element at index 0 and multiply it with the corresponding element from the other vector.
            You then do the same with all the elements and them sum them all together. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Element-wise Operations:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])
            vector_b = np.array([4,5,6])

            result_square = np.square(vector_a)
            result_sqrt = np.sqrt(vector_a)
            result_exp = np.exp(vector_a)

            result_square, result_sqrt, result_exp
        </py-repl>
        <p>It's just like the scalar, but the difference is the operation, for example square is done 
            to all the elements. Think of it as a sliding window and whenever some value is passed over, 
            it is being squared.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Sum and Mean:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])
            vector_b = np.array([4,5,6])

            sum_vector = np.sum(vector_a)
            mean_vector = np.mean(vector_a)

            sum_vector, mean_vector
        </py-repl>
        <p>Sum vector is self described. The mean is the average value of the vector/s. 
            For example the mean vector of 'vector_a' is 2. Sum(1,2,3) which results in 6 and then 
            divide this with the length of the vector.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Concatenation:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])
            vector_b = np.array([4,5,6])

            concatenated_vector = np.concatenate((vector_a, vector_b))
        </py-repl>
        <p>It glues them together.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Broadcasting:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])

            vector_a = vector_a + 10
            vector_a
        </py-repl>
        <p>I explained it earlier. The 10 becomes [10, 10, 10] in the background. Therefore the result is
            [11, 12, 13]
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Reshape:</p>
        <py-repl>
            import numpy as np

            vector_a = np.array([1,2,3])

            reshaped_vector = vector_a.reshape((3, 1))
            reshaped_vector
        </py-repl>
        <p>The reshaping thing will be very handy in the future. All you have to remember when reshaping 
            a vector, 1D or 2D or 3D vector is this: let's say the original shape is (4,3). You could do 
            (6,2), (12, 1) and so on, so the new shape must add up to the original shape.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        
    </ul>
